# E-commerce-DataBase-Design-Project
## Introduction
In the era where everything is associated with the internet, online shopping is no longer
the latest concept. “In 2021, the number of global digital buyers was 2.14 billion. As of October
2022, the world population comprises over 7.9 billion people. That means at least 27% of the
worldwide population shop online to fulfill their needs.” (Maisha & Jordana, 2022) This refers to
the fact that out of four people, one of them describes themselves as an online shopper.
On the other hand, data, as a concept, has been immersed in our life as well. When A
traditional field got transformed into the form of digital, the implied features of such a field
would be embodied as certain types of data which, in general, are sizing enormously. So then,
the measurement degree of key performance indicators in such a field has evolved, requiring a
better platform for all stakeholders to analyze and to be able to utilize. The same statement was
made by Prince Bharadwaj and other associated authors in 2022: “One of the biggest benefits of
using a database for e-commerce is structuring vast amounts of shop data.”
As the conclusion of the introduction section, the need of handling the massive amount of
data along with its form of being digital ensured the feasibility of the database management
system. In this paper, we have introduced a classic, typical and default version of the database 
management system structure, as well as some possible business questions along with the
practical queries to each question.
